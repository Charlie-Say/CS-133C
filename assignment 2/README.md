DESIGN

1.1.1 - 1) create variables to store range of numbers
        2) ask for secret number
        3) store secret number in variable
        4) ask player 2 to make guesses using a loop
        5) use if statements to change the range of numbers
        6) give option to play again

1.1.2 - The overall task was to design a program that will take in a user input from player 1 and have player 2 guess
the secret number. Given that player 2 has a limited amount of guesses. The program will also output the given integer range
as player 2 makes consecutive guesses.

TESTING

1.2.2 - Some tests I made were to input a number outside the range. For every guess that would change the range, I would test
to see if an input outside that range would be acceptable. The problem I faced was that the range would change even if I told
the user that the secret number was within a certain range.

REFLECTION

1.3.1 - The overall lesson of the week was to implement the use of basic operators, get familiar with conditions and statements,
and the use of loops.

1.3.2 - I learned that it is very similar to python, it is just understanding the syntax of the language that will be the difficult
part. I learned the use of basic operators and how to successfully implement them into my program.

1.3.3 - I wish I knew how to permit the user from giving an input that is outside the range of specific integers.

1.3.5 - The hardest part was the implementation of the project. Finding a solution to the bug where the change of range from the
user input would change how the program itself worked.

1.3.7 - Google. It helped me understand the syntax needed for my loops, statements, and conditions.

1.3.8 - This project does seem related to future projects. It's helped me understand the basics needed to write a program.
