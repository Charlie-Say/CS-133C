Weekly Report

1.1 - The project is asking me to create a variable for each of the primitive data types.
      Then I will output each value with a print statement.
      I will then create a GitHub repository for CS 133C to push code from the assignments.
      
1.1.1      --- PSEUDOCODE ---

      char ran_char = -5;
      unsigned char unsigned_char = 'A';
      int ran_int = 1;
      signed int sign_int = -1;
      unsigned int unsign_int = 2;
      short int short_int = -97;
      unsigned short int unsign_short_int = 97;
      long int long_int = -2343563;
      unsigned long int unsign_long_int = 2345637;
      float my_float = 3.145;
      double my_double = 3.14;
      long double long_double = 3.321354;
      
      printf("My char is: %c\n", ran_char);
      printf("My signed char is: %c\n", signed_char);
      printf("My unsigned char is: %c\n", unsigned_char);
      printf("My integer is: %d\n", ran_int);
      printf("My signed integer is: %d\n", sign_int);
      printf("My unsigned integer is: %d\n", unsign_int);
      printf("My short integer is: %d\n", short_int);
      printf("My unsigned short integer is: %d\n", unsign_short_int);
      printf("My long integer is: %d\n", long_int);
      printf("My unsigned long integer is: %d\n", unsign_long_int);
      printf("My float is: %f\n", my_float);
      printf("My double is: %lf\n", my_double);
      printf("My long double is: %Lg\n", long_double);

      REFLECTION
      
1.1.2 - Create a variable for each primitive data type and then output with a print statement.
1.2 - The lesson for this week was to learn about the data types that exists in C language.

1.4.1 - One of the problems I had was understanding specifiers. I did further research on it to fully understand
how it works.
1.4.4 - Understanding specifiers was one of the major adjustments I had to make since the only other language I've used
was python.
1.4.5 - Some of the details that someone might miss would be about actually understanding the data types, when to use them
and when it isn't necessary.
1.4.6 - Google. It helped me understand the syntax needed and how to use the data types.
1.4.7 - Yes. I think that getting acquainted with this subject will help in future projects and will be used quite frequently.
